            <p class="content">Luffy accepts the challenge of Captain Morgan to fight and charges at Morgan. With Luffy charging at Morgan, Koby requests him to crush those marines. Koby requests Luffy to correct them from wrong doings. Luffy takes a swing and punches Morgan with full power. With the punch Morgan reveals himself to be Axe-Hand Morgan. Since Luffy is not a ranked criminal with a bounty on his head Morgan is surprised. The two engage in a great battle, with Luffy dogging each of Morgan's attack. Koby and the marines are surprised by this. Luffy manages to miss one of Morgan's strongest attack which splits the ground into two. With all of Morgan's attacks missing and Luffy gains the upper hand. Luffy attacks twice to knock-out Morgan to the ground. The combat with Luffy's humorous comments really keeps the audience engaged. Each marine soldier is surprised at Morgan's defeat and Morgan being no match for Luffy. Luffy is angry at Morgan to set a wrong example of marines to Koby and crushing his dream. With Morgan on the ground and pounding him with his fists Luffy gets his anger out. To save Morgan Helmeppo, Morgan's son, puts Koby at gunpoint with fear. Without paying attention to Helmeppo Luffy continues hitting Morgan until Zoro catches his attention. Although Helmeppo expected Luffy to panic and plead him to leave Koby but to his surprise Luffy smiled. Looking at Luffy's smile Koby declared that he won't interfere in Luffy's dream and asked Luffy to not bother about him. Even if it ends with his death. But as helpful as Luffy is, Luffy decides to help Koby. Luffy turns toward Helmeppo and gets ready to attack, but Morgan stands up behind Luffy. Looking at Morgan's fearsome figure Koby warns Luffy about Morgan. Just as Morgan gets ready to swing his axe at Luffy, Luffy uses Gomu Gomu no Pistol at Helmeppo saving Koby. With Luffy at his reach Morgan is struck by Zoro's three sword style. Zoro slashes Morgan across his chest landing Morgan with injuries. By the end it is official that the Pirate Hunter Roronoa Zoro accepts Monkey D. Luffy as his captain.</p></br>
